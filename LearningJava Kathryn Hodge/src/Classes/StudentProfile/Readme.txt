# Student Profile Attributes

1: First name
2: Last name
3: Expected Year to Graduate 
4: GPA 
5: Declared Major

# Student Profile Behaviour

1: The student profile should have atleast one behaviour
2: Sometimes a student cannot get into the right classes in order to graduate
on time and must graduate the following year
3: We should have a function that increments a student's expected graduation 
year by one

# Creating and Using a Student profile

1: The student profile class should have a constructor that initialized all 
of the attributes with dynamic values, meaning the values that the constructor is called
with will determine the values of the attributes.
2: Your program should create two student profile instances that represent two
different student profiles.
3: Your program should call incrementExpectedGraduationYear on one of the student
profiles and print out their expected graduation year instance value to the console.
